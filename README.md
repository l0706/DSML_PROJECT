## TODOs

### Data Cleaning

- [x] Remove rows with `trip_miles == 0` or `trip_seconds == 0`
- [ ] Drop rows with missing or corrupt `trip_start_timestamp`
- [ ] Handle missing values in `fare`, `trip_total`, or location fields
- [ ] Ensure datetime columns are in proper format
- [ ] Extract `hour` and `day_of_week` from timestamps

### Feature Engineering

- [x] Add `traffic_volume` as a new feature (`trip_seconds / trip_miles`)
- [ ] Extract time-based features (hour, weekday)
- [ ] Include pickup and dropoff community areas as features
- [ ] Add external weather data (e.g., via Meteostat API)
